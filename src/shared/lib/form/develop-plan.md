# Step-by-Step Plan to Implement the Library

## 1. Implement the `Validator` Class

- [ ] **Define Validation Methods:**
    - [ ] `validate`: Accept a value and run it against a schema (`ZodSchema`). Use the schema's `safeParse` method for
      error handling.
    - [ ] `validateAsync`: Handle asynchronous validation using an optional `asyncValidationFn`.
- [ ] **Integrate Constructor:**
    - [ ] Accept parameters for the schema and asynchronous validation function.
    - [ ] Store these as private properties for encapsulation.
- [ ] **Use SRP and Strategy Pattern:**
    - [ ] Ensure the `Validator` only handles validation logic, making it interchangeable and reusable across different
      field types.
- [ ] **Collaborate with Fields:**
    - [ ] Each field class should delegate its validation logic to the `Validator`, ensuring separation of concerns.

### Concepts and Patterns

- [ ] **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.
- [ ] **Strategy Pattern** for pluggable validation strategies.

### Recommended Learning

- [ ] Learn Zod documentation for schema validation.
- [ ] Study the Strategy Design Pattern (ref: "Head First Design Patterns").

## 2. Build the `FormField` Class

- [ ] **Define Core Properties:**
    - [ ] `value`, `error`, `touched`, `disabled`, `loading`, and metadata for field extensibility.
- [ ] **Initialize with `Validator`:**
    - [ ] Use the `Validator` instance to handle field-level validation.
- [ ] **Add Methods:**
    - [ ] `setValue`: Updates the field value and triggers validation.
    - [ ] `validate`: Delegates to the `Validator` for validation.
    - [ ] `validateAsync`: Calls the asynchronous validation method.
    - [ ] `reset`: Resets the field state (`touched`, `error`, etc.).
- [ ] **Leverage MobX:**
    - [ ] Use `makeAutoObservable` for reactive updates.
- [ ] **Apply Observer Pattern:**
    - [ ] Notify observers when the field value changes (e.g., for dependent fields).

### Concepts and Patterns

- [ ] **Observer Pattern** for notifying changes.
- [ ] **Encapsulation** to hide implementation details.
- [ ] **MobX** for state management.

### Recommended Learning

- [ ] Study MobX documentation and observable patterns.
- [ ] Learn about encapsulation principles in OOP.

## 3. Implement the `FieldArray` Class

- [ ] **Define Core Properties:**
    - [ ] `fields`: An array of `FormField` instances.
- [ ] **Provide Methods:**
    - [ ] `addField`: Adds a new `FormField` with an optional value.
    - [ ] `removeField`: Removes a field at a specified index.
    - [ ] `validateAll`: Validates all fields in the array.
- [ ] **Use Schema Validation:**
    - [ ] Pass a schema (`ZodSchema`) to each `FormField` instance for validation consistency.
- [ ] **MobX Integration:**
    - [ ] Wrap methods in `makeAutoObservable` for reactivity.

### Concepts and Patterns

- [ ] **Composition** for managing collections of fields.
- [ ] **Encapsulation** for state and behavior of field arrays.

### Recommended Learning

- [ ] Learn MobX advanced usage for reactive collections.

---

## 4. Build the `MiddlewarePipeline`

- [ ] **Define Middleware Registration:**
    - [ ] Provide a `use` method to add middleware functions to the pipeline.
- [ ] **Execute Middlewares:**
    - [ ] Implement an `execute` method to sequentially invoke all middlewares with form values.
- [ ] **Pattern Usage:**
    - [ ] Apply the **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** to manage middleware execution.
- [ ] **Collaborate with `FormStore`:**
    - [ ] Integrate the middleware pipeline with the form submission process.

### Concepts and Patterns

- [ ] **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** for sequential middleware execution.
- [ ] **Decoupling** form logic from middleware processing.

### Recommended Learning

- [ ] Study middleware concepts in frameworks like Express.js.

---

## 5. Create the `FormStore` Class

- [ ] **Define Properties:**
    - [ ] `fields` and `fieldArrays` for form state.
    - [ ] `steps` and `currentStep` for step-based forms.
    - [ ] `middlewarePipeline` for middleware management.
- [ ] **Add Methods:**
    - [ ] `validateAll`: Validate all fields and field arrays.
    - [ ] `submit`: Run validation and execute middleware pipeline.
    - [ ] `nextStep`/`prevStep`: Manage form steps.
- [ ] **Integration:**
    - [ ] Ensure `FormStore` interacts seamlessly with `FormField`, `FieldArray`, and `MiddlewarePipeline`.
- [ ] **MobX for Reactivity:**
    - [ ] Use `makeAutoObservable` to make state reactive.

### Concepts and Patterns

- [ ] **Centralized State Management**.
- [ ] **Encapsulation** for managing form logic.
- [ ] **Composition** for integrating fields, arrays, and middleware.

### Recommended Learning

- [ ] Study state management concepts and MobX advanced topics.

---

## 6. Implement Specialized Fields

- [ ] **Inheritance:**
    - [ ] Extend `FormField` for specialized fields.
    - [ ] Add custom methods (e.g., `setTrimmedValue` in `TextField`).
- [ ] **Customization:**
    - [ ] Add field-specific validation logic, such as min/max validation for `NumberField`.

### Concepts and Patterns

- [ ] **Inheritance** for extending base field functionality.
- [ ] **OOP Principles** like polymorphism.

### Recommended Learning

- [ ] Study TypeScript inheritance and polymorphism.
